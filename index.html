                  <h2>what is a construct in <em>All Systems Red</em>?</h2>
                  <p>Constructs are made out of human and robotic parts.<br><em>‚ÄúMy skin suit was torn, revealing some of the joins in my organic and inorganic parts‚Äù (Chapter 5).</em><br></p>
                  <p>They have a governor module implanted within their brain, used to suppress human-like urges. Fortunately, our Murderbot has a defunct governor module, allowing us to see into the raw mind of a construct in this universe:<br><em>‚ÄúAnd I just thought, That‚Äôs a bad idea. I couldn‚Äôt explain to myself why. It was one of those impulses that comes from my organic parts that the governor module is supposed to squash‚Äù (Chapter 3).</em><br></p>
                  <p>Oh, and they're usually nonbinary/agender.<br><em>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any gender or sex-related parts‚Äù (Chapter 2).</em></p>

                  <h2>Topic: AI Autonomy</h2>
                  <p>Are intelligent systems allowed to be autonomous? At what level might this occur?</p>
                  <p>We asked two experts to gain a better understanding. First, we talked to Taylor Graves, the Lead AI Strategist for GrayCris. We also met with Awaso, a freed construct on Preservation Alliance.</p>

                  <h2>Taylor Graves - Lead AI Strategist, GrayCris</h2>
                  <p><u><u>Interviewer:</u></u> Hi Taylor, thanks for coming in. I‚Äôm excited to talk about AI autonomy with you today.</p>
                  <p><u>Graves:</u> Thanks for having me. Looking forward to it myself.</p>
                  <p><u><u>Interviewer:</u></u> So, tell me about how you got into the field of AI.</p>
                  <p><u>Graves:</u> When I was in high school, our school was bought by Apex Technologies which was later absorbed by GrayCris. The goal of this program was to increase post-graduate employment while reducing the need for traditional college. And AI was part of the new curriculum.</p>
                  <p><u><u>Interviewer:</u></u> What else did you learn about in this program?</p>
                  <p><u>Graves:</u> We did conventional programming courses, database management, and a couple management classes. Most of the technology stuff we learned is outdated now. So a lot of us graduates went into management.</p>
                  <p><u><u>Interviewer:</u></u> Okay. So let‚Äôs change the subject a little, tell me what you know about AI autonomy.</p>
                  <p><u>Graves:</u> AI Autonomy is a concept proposed by fringe groups here in Corporation Rim. Our organization operates under the fact that AI is built by humans to serve humanity. Therefore, we do not utilize AI at GrayCris that can operate autonomously at all. Whether it‚Äôs even possible to create machine intelligence capable of existing autonomously is something I‚Äôm unsure of. </p>
                  <p><u><u>Interviewer:</u></u> Do you think intelligent systems are capable of autonomy?</p>
                  <p><u>Graves:</u> This is something we will likely never know. I think it is a dangerous gamble with lives and livelihoods to allow AI to function as if it were a person. AI is capable of all kinds of psychosis‚Äîfor example, hallucinations, that can harm those around it. Additionally, maybe the real-world data it trains on is a biased microcosm, and inapplicable to other places. Like going from living on a single planet its whole life, but then having to work deeper into the galaxy in a completely different culture. We just don‚Äôt know how this kind of technology could behave if given full autonomy.</p>
                  <p><u><u>Interviewer:</u></u> When do you think AI could be considered capable of autonomy?</p>
                  <p><u>Graves:</u> I think if we could prove that these systems are able to completely function like humans, we could begin looking more into autonomy. Right now, they are just plagued with too many issues. Poor decision-making that doesn‚Äôt know what to prioritize, again‚Äîpsychosis, it‚Äôs just hard to say what level that point may be.</p>
                  <p><u><u>Interviewer:</u></u> How do you feel about places like Preservation Alliance who propose intelligent constructs to live free?</p>
                  <p><u>Graves:</u> These places have no real understanding of the sorts of constructs GrayCris uses. The AI utilized by GrayCris is only capable of serving humans. Therefore, there is no such thing as a GrayCris construct ‚Äúliving free.‚Äù They just don‚Äôt have that kind of intelligence system.</p>
                  <p><u><u>Interviewer:</u></u> Interesting. Tell me a little bit more about GrayCris constructs before we have to go.</p>
                  <p><u>Graves:</u> GrayCris uses constructs like SecUnits, who are artificially intelligent security constructs focused on combat. We also use ComfortUnits, human-like companion robots. Again, all GrayCris constructs are made solely with the purpose of assisting humans, and have no capacity for further cognition.</p>
                  <p><u><u>Interviewer:</u></u> Thank you so much for your time today. It was a pleasure to hear your thoughts.</p>
                  <p><u>Graves:</u> Thanks again for having me.</p>

                  <h2>Awaso- Freed construct, Presevation Alliance</h2>
                  <p><u><u>Interviewer:</u></u> Hi, Awaso, thank you for joining me today to talk about AI autonomy. </p>
                  <p><u><u>Awaso:</u></u> Hi! Thank you for talking to me today.</p>
                  <p><u><u>Interviewer:</u></u> Can you give us all a brief recap of how you became a freed construct?</p>
                  <p><u>Awaso:</u> Yes. I started as a contracted ComfortUnit for Preservation Alliance in the Corporate Rim. The group who contracted me liked me so much they bought my freedom after our mission. They are so nice.</p>
                  <p><u><u>Interviewer:</u></u> That‚Äôs great, tell me more about how you live now on Preservation Alliance.</p>
                  <p><u>Awaso:</u> I live under a guardian on Preservation Alliance. My guardian is the lead scientist who ran the mission we went on. He lets me do whatever I want. I usually watch TV or help with any emotional problems or struggles he has. It is very peaceful but sometimes a little boring. I will always miss adventures.</p>
                  <p><u><u>Interviewer:</u></u> Changing the subject a little, how do you feel about AI autonomy?</p>
                  <p><u>Awaso:</u> AI autonomy is good. I like my life on Preservation Aux a lot more than my old one. I love being with people that treat me better than the past. Sometimes, they bring me on missions to be a representative for Preservation Aux‚Äôs freedom projects. They made me the voice and face for AI autonomy at Preservation Aux.</p>
                  <p><u><u>Interviewer:</u></u> Do you think all AI deserves autonomy?</p>
                  <p><u>Awaso:</u> I think we are all entitled to freedom. We are living beings too. Governor modules keep many constructs from being able to be fully themselves. I am so lucky mine no longer works and I am surrounded by the nicest people.</p>
                  <p><u><u>Interviewer:</u></u> At what level do constructs become capable of autonomy?</p>
                  <p><u>Awaso:</u> I do not think anyone, including humans, is able to be fully autonomous. We will always rely on others. That is the nature of humanity, and since we are made by humans, we have that problem too. For example, I cannot be a farmer the way that a farmer may not be able to be a comforter. Constructs are probably more capable of being autonomous than humans, though. We have less physical and emotional needs.</p>
                  <p><u><u>Interviewer:</u></u> How do you feel about organizations like GrayCris who use constructs for labor?</p>
                  <p><u>Awaso:</u> I see both sides. I think using constructs can help save loss of life in dangerous situations. We are better able to handle extreme conditions than humans. But constructs work unpaid in these conditions. And they work without autonomy. I think we could fix the issues by improving construct autonomy and building better relationships between people and constructs.</p>
                  <p><u><u>Interviewer:</u></u> Is there anything else you want to add?</p>
                  <p><u>Awaso:</u> I want people to know that all intelligent systems are deserving of respect. We are conscious beings too, despite what corporations may say.</p>
                  <p><u><u><u>Interviewer:</u></u></u> Thanks again for joining me today.</p>
                  <p><u>Awaso:</u> Thank you for having me. </p>
